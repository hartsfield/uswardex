# USWARDEX

**USWARDEX** is a war index, which is a service which catalogues county-level
statistics relating to the socio-political continuum on which rests the
foundations of the United States of America.

## Stats intended to be catalogued (incomplete)
 - County Population
 - County Area
 - County Population Density
 - Deployed Troops Per County
 - Airports Per County
 - Hospitals Per County
 - Ambulances Per County
 - Local Law Enforcement Per County
 - Should be able to view state totals as well

## Want to add to the svg
 - Important bridges
 - Major rivers/bodies of water
 - Interstates and other important roads
 - Maybe do a weather radar overlay
 - Maybe Military/Gov flight tracker
